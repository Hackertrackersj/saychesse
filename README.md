# saychesse
The tool generates a malicious HTTPS page using Ngrok Port Forwarding method, and a javascript code to perform cam requests using MediaDevices.getUserMedia.  The MediaDevices.getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media. That stream can include, for example, a video track (produced by either a hardware or virtual video source such as a camera, video recording device, screen sharing service, and so forth), an audio track (similarly, produced by a physical or virtual audio source like a microphone, A/D converter, or the like), and possibly other track types.
